# README - Back End Folder (BE)

## Overview

Create a `BE` folder inside `sources` (e.g. `Runway-Training/BE`). Place all backend-related code and artifacts in this folder — for example APIs, training scripts, data processing, and other backend services.

## Project Structure (example)

```
Runway-Training/
└─ BE/
   ├─ api/
   ├─ training/
   ├─ scripts/
   └─ README.md
```

## Workflow / How we work

* When starting work, create a new branch using one of the following naming conventions depending on the task type:

  * `feature/{{name}}`
  * `implement/{{name}}`
  * `bugfix/{{bug_name}}`
  * ... (other prefixes as needed)

* Implement and test your changes on the feature/implement/bugfix branch.

* When development is complete, open a Pull Request (PR) **into `main`**.

* **Do not commit directly to `main`.** All changes must go through a PR for review.
